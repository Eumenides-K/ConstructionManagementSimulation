# ConstructionManagementSimulation
A construction management simulation game for MSc/BSc management students to play.

# Introduction
A statement of the problem that your project addresses including motivation, aims, objectives and challenges of the project, description of the client and the brief, how you refined and improved the original brief, and your interaction with the client to achieve this.

---

# Background
- A description of the background and context of the project and its relation to work already done in the area. What existing solutions are there?
- Discussion of technical solutions or frameworks present in work/solutions already in the market/published.
- Discussion of any related academic work related to the problem area.
- Discussion of available tools/methodologies for implementing solution to brief and their integrability


---

# Design

- A description of the methodology used to develop software as a team, organise and delegate work, track progress and ensure delivery (e.g. Agile).
- A description of the work carried out. This should include details of technical or scientific problems tackled, solutions proposed, and the design and development of software. For example, you might provide a description of user stories in each sprint, features delivered at each sprint and how backlog was refined at each stage. We want to see evidence of clear stages of development and prototyping (including wireframes etc) with discussion of the design decisions made at each step. For example, you might include minutes from sprint planning meetings and iterative client feedback at each stage to demonstrate how your project evolved.
Evidence of source control. Use links to your github repo (merge/branch/commits) along with code snippets within your report to highlight important parts inline with the body of your text. A well documented repository is expected and required to be submitted.

# Evaluation and testing

- A description and analysis of results obtained.
- Details of Tests developed and results which demonstrate robust implementation
- Details of User Evaluation, if appropriate, to demonstrate how objectives are met.


---

# Conclusion
- A critical evaluation of the work. This is an analysis of the extent to which the project has achieved its objectives, and whether the choices that were made were, with hindsight, the best ones.
- Suggestions on possible improvements and/or further work.
- Contribution Statement. Indicating how the team collectively believe work and effort has been split through the assessment. Please include here details of anyone who contributed but then moved to the delayed project (resit) and their contribution to this point.
